Context, Containers, Components and Code

This is part of my growing collection of documentation tools.  They will be based on the needs that I have run into.  There will most likely be items that are not implemented yet.  
If you find something missing, just let me know and it may be added to the backlog, for future releases.

This tool will allow you to write C# code and automatically generate png diagrams as a part of the build process.  (Think nUnit and unit testing)

How to read a class diagram

The class diagram generator that is included in this project will reflect over a compiled assembly.  
It is based on the work done in https://github.com/pierre3/PlantUmlClassDiagramGenerator.  
If you have access to the source code, and this project is missing a feature, I would recommendd using Pierre's project.  
I will continue to add features to this project as they become necessary or requested.
