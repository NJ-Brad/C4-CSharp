# C4-CSharp
Generates C4 diagrams from C# (via PlantUML)

If you have never heard of C4 models, check out https://c4model.com/

Context, Containers, Components and Code

This is part of my growing collection of documentation tools.  They will be based on the needs that I have run into.  There will most likely be items that are not implemented yet.  
If you find something missing, just let me know and it may be added to the backlog, for future releases.

This tool will allow you to write C# code and automatically generate png diagrams as a part of the build process.  (Think nUnit and unit testing)
